Consistent Design System:
Create a design system with consistent colors, typography, spacing, and component styles.
Utilize Tailwind's configuration file (tailwind.config.js) to define your custom design tokens.

Types:
Types should always be explicitly defined, both in Typescript and Python. 

Styling:
For linting in typescript it should use AIRBNB linting style.

Performance Optimization:
Use React.lazy() and Suspense for code-splitting and lazy-loading components.
Implement virtualization for long lists using libraries like react-window.
Optimize images and use next/image for automatic image optimization in Next.js.

Responsive Typography:
Use Tailwind's text utilities with responsive prefixes to adjust font sizes across different screens.
Consider using a fluid typography system for seamless scaling.

Accessibility:
Ensure proper color contrast ratios using Tailwind's text-* and bg-* classes.
Use semantic HTML elements and ARIA attributes where necessary.
Implement keyboard navigation support.

Touch-Friendly UI:
Make interactive elements (buttons, links) at least 44x44 pixels for easy tapping.
Implement touch gestures for common actions (swipe, pinch-to-zoom) where appropriate.

WHEN CREATING A FILE DON'T CONFLICT IT WITH .TSX AND .JSX FILES

Firebase Best Practices:
Implement proper security rules in Firebase.
Use Firebase SDK's offline persistence for better performance and offline support.
Optimize queries to minimize read/write operations.

Error Handling and Feedback:
Implement proper error boundaries in React.
Provide clear feedback for user actions (loading states, success/error messages).

Animation and Transitions:
Use subtle animations to enhance UX (e.g., page transitions, micro-interactions).
Utilize Tailwind's transition utilities or consider libraries like Framer Motion.

Form Handling:
Use libraries like Formik or react-hook-form for efficient form management.
Implement proper form validation with clear error messages.

Code Organization:
Follow a consistent folder structure (e.g., components, hooks, pages, services).
Use custom hooks to encapsulate and reuse logic.

Implement authentication using Firebase.
