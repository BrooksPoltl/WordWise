- readability making too many requests (done)
- cant sign out on editor. (instead of sign out button create a user profile dropdown)
- Some of conciseness is that it needs to remove but it doesn't tell you
- I set the algorithms for readability to 1 for testing, will need to change back to 5
- AI rewrites (readability, passive) are lost if text changes during API call. This is likely a race condition where the suggestion ID changes mid-request, so when the response returns, it can't find the original suggestion to update. (done)
- display name is not optional
- Pasting large text does not work initially (could be bullet issue?) Detects the errors but doesn't highlight
