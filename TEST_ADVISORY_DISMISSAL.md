# Advisory Comment Management Test

## New Features Implemented

### 1. Hash-Based Permanent Dismissal
- Each advisory comment is now hashed based on its text content + category
- Users can permanently dismiss comments for specific text + category combinations
- Dismissed comments will never appear again for that exact text and category

### 2. Modal View for Comments
- New "View Comments" button appears when advisory comments are available
- Modal shows comments one by one with navigation (Previous/Next)
- Each comment displays:
  - Selected text that triggered the comment
  - AI suggestion/explanation
  - Category information
  - Navigation controls
  - Dismissal options

### 3. Two Dismissal Options
- **Skip This Time**: Hides comment temporarily (will reappear on next analysis)
- **Never Show Again**: Permanently dismisses this text + category combination

## Testing Instructions

1. **Generate Comments**: Type substantial content (50+ characters) and wait 2 seconds for auto-refresh
2. **View Inline**: Click on yellow highlighted text to see popover
3. **View in Modal**: Click "View Comments" button in header to see modal interface
4. **Test Navigation**: Use Previous/Next buttons to navigate through comments
5. **Test Temporary Dismissal**: Click "Skip This Time" - comment disappears but may return
6. **Test Permanent Dismissal**: Click "Never Show Again" - comment permanently removed
7. **Verify Persistence**: Edit the same text again - permanently dismissed comments should not reappear

## Implementation Details

### Hash Function
- Combines normalized text + category into unique identifier
- Uses simple multiplication-based hash (no bitwise operators for linting compliance)
- Returns base-36 string for compact storage

### Store Updates
- Added `dismissedHashes` Set to advisory state
- New `dismissCommentPermanently` action
- Automatic filtering of dismissed comments on `setComments`

### UI Components
- Enhanced `AdvisoryModal` with navigation and dismissal options
- Updated `EditorHeader` with comment count badge and modal trigger
- Maintained consistent yellow theme throughout

### Performance
- Hash-based filtering is O(1) lookup time
- Dismissed hashes stored in memory (client-side only)
- No database persistence required

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Basic Dismissal
1. Get advisory comments on text: "This is good"
2. Permanently dismiss "Strengthen Claims" suggestion
3. Edit text to "This is really good" 
4. Verify "Strengthen Claims" doesn't appear for similar weak language

### Scenario 2: Category-Specific Dismissal
1. Get comments on: "We should consider this approach"
2. Dismiss "Define Terms" for "approach"
3. Get comments on: "This approach works well"
4. Verify "Define Terms" still appears (different context)
5. Verify other categories still work for "approach"

### Scenario 3: Modal Navigation
1. Generate 5+ advisory comments
2. Open modal, navigate through all comments
3. Dismiss some temporarily, some permanently
4. Verify navigation updates correctly
5. Verify modal closes when no comments remain

## Expected Behavior

✅ **Concurrent Comments**: More comments generated due to parallel API requests
✅ **Modal Interface**: Clean one-by-one comment review
✅ **Permanent Dismissal**: Hash-based filtering prevents re-showing
✅ **Temporary Dismissal**: Comments hidden until next analysis
✅ **Navigation**: Smooth previous/next with auto-advance on dismissal
✅ **Performance**: Fast hash lookups, no database overhead
✅ **UI Consistency**: Yellow theme matches existing design
