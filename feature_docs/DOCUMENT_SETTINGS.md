# Document Settings Feature

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED

This feature allows users to update the `documentType` and `context` of an existing document from within the editor.

## Implementation Summary

Users can now:
- Update document type via a dropdown menu below the editor toolbar
- Update document context via a modal triggered by a "Context" button
- Both settings are saved immediately to Firestore when changed
- Word and character counts have been removed from the editor header as requested
- Current document type is filtered out of the dropdown options
- Document state is refreshed after updates to reflect changes immediately

## Key Features

### Document Type Dropdown
- **Role-based Options**: Dropdown is populated with document types specific to the user's role (Product Manager or Software Engineer)
- **Current Type Filtering**: The currently selected document type is excluded from the dropdown options
- **Immediate Saving**: Document type changes are saved to Firestore immediately upon selection
- **State Refresh**: Local document state is updated after Firestore save to reflect changes

### Context Modal
- **Outlined Button Style**: "Context" button uses outline styling as requested
- **Rich Text Area**: Modal provides a large text area for detailed context input
- **Immediate Saving**: Context changes are saved to Firestore immediately when the user clicks "Save"
- **Loading States**: Modal shows loading spinner during save operations

### UI Improvements
- **Clean Header**: Removed word and character counts from editor header for cleaner interface
- **Integrated Layout**: Settings bar is seamlessly integrated below the main editor toolbar
- **Responsive Design**: All components work well on different screen sizes

## Frontend

| Priority | Task | Implementation Details | Code Pointers | Dependencies | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |:--- |:--- |
| 1 | Update `DocumentUpdatePayload` type | Add optional `context` and `documentType` fields to the `DocumentUpdatePayload` interface. | `src/types/index.ts` | - | ✅ Completed |
| 1 | Enhance `updateDocument` action | Modify the `updateDocument` action to handle `context` and `documentType` updates and send them to Firestore. | `src/store/document/document.actions.ts`| `DocumentUpdatePayload` update | ✅ Completed |
| 2 | Remove Word/Character Count | Remove the word and character count display from the editor header. | `src/components/editor/EditorHeader.tsx` | - | ✅ Completed |
| 3 | Create `DocumentSettingsBar` component | Create a new component to house the document settings controls (document type dropdown, context button). This will be displayed below the main `EditorToolbar`. | `src/components/editor/DocumentSettingsBar.tsx` (new file) | `EditorContainer.tsx` | ✅ Completed |
| 4 | Implement "Update Context" Modal | Create a modal that allows users to view and edit the document's context. A button in `DocumentSettingsBar` with the text "Context" (outline, no fill) will trigger this modal. The modal will use the enhanced `updateDocument` action to save changes. | `src/components/editor/UpdateContextModal.tsx` (new file) | `updateDocument` action | ✅ Completed |
| 5 | Implement "Document Type" Dropdown | Add a dropdown to the `DocumentSettingsBar` to allow users to change the document type. It will be populated based on the user's role and use the `updateDocument` action to save changes. | `src/components/editor/DocumentSettingsBar.tsx` | `updateDocument` action, user role from `authStore` | ✅ Completed |
| 6 | Integrate `DocumentSettingsBar` | Add the new `DocumentSettingsBar` component into the editor layout, likely within `DocumentEditor.tsx` or `EditorContainer.tsx`. | `src/components/DocumentEditor.tsx`, `src/components/EditorContainer.tsx` | `DocumentSettingsBar` component | ✅ Completed |

## Backend

Since we are using direct Firestore operations via the `updateDocument` action on the client, no separate backend (Firebase Functions) changes are required. The existing Firestore rules should suffice as users are only editing their own documents.

## Files Created/Modified

### Created
- `src/components/editor/DocumentSettingsBar.tsx` - Component housing document type dropdown and context button
- `src/components/editor/UpdateContextModal.tsx` - Modal for editing document context

### Modified
- `src/types/index.ts` - Added `context` and `documentType` to `DocumentUpdatePayload`
- `src/store/document/document.actions.ts` - Enhanced `updateDocument` to handle new fields and refresh document state
- `src/components/editor/EditorHeader.tsx` - Removed word/character count props and display
- `src/components/TextEditor.tsx` - Integrated `DocumentSettingsBar`, removed word/character count usage
- `src/hooks/useTextEditor.ts` - Removed unused word/character count calculations

## Bug Fixes & Improvements

### Fixed Issues
- ✅ **Document Type Saving**: Fixed issue where document type changes weren't being saved properly by adding document state refresh after Firestore updates
- ✅ **Immediate Saving**: Both document type and context changes now save immediately to Firestore
- ✅ **Dropdown Filtering**: Current document type is now excluded from dropdown options to prevent redundant selections
- ✅ **State Synchronization**: Local document state is refreshed after updates to immediately reflect changes in the UI

### Enhanced UX
- Better error boundaries and loading states
- Improved dropdown styling with borders and hover effects
- "No other types available" message when all types are filtered out
- Cleaner editor interface with removed word/character counts

## Testing

- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes
- ✅ ESLint passes with no errors
- ✅ Frontend build successful
- ✅ All existing tests pass
- ✅ Document type saving functionality verified
- ✅ Context modal functionality verified
- ✅ Dropdown filtering working correctly

The feature is now fully functional and ready for production use. Users can seamlessly manage their document settings directly from the editor interface with immediate persistence and proper state management.
