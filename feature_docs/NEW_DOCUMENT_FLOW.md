# New Document Flow Feature

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED

## Overview

This feature enhances the document creation process by allowing users to provide optional context and select document types tailored to their role. This information will be used to improve AI suggestions and provide more relevant writing assistance.

## Implementation Details

### Phase 1: Role Simplification ✅
- Updated user roles to focus on Product Manager and Software Engineer only
- Updated frontend constants in `src/constants/userConstants.ts`
- Updated backend validation in `functions/src/handlers/userProfile.ts`
- Updated documentation

### Phase 2: Backend Development ✅
- Updated Document interface to include `context?: string` and `documentType?: string` fields
- Created document constants in `src/constants/documentConstants.ts` with role-specific document types
- Updated DocumentCreatePayload to include new optional fields
- Updated Firestore document fetching to handle new fields
- Enhanced existing createDocument action to handle new fields

### Phase 3: Frontend Development ✅
- Created `NewDocumentModal` component with responsive design
- Integrated modal into Dashboard via DocumentList component
- Implemented form with title input, context textarea, and document type selection
- Added proper form validation and loading states
- Connected to enhanced createDocument action

## Document Types by Role

### Product Manager
- Product Requirements Document (PRD)
- User Story
- Feature Specification
- Product Roadmap

### Software Engineer
- Technical Design Document (TDD)
- API Documentation
- Post-Mortem Analysis
- Request for Comments (RFC)

## Technical Implementation

### Backend
- **Direct Firestore Operations**: Documents are created directly in Firestore using the enhanced createDocument action
- **Type Safety**: Updated DocumentCreatePayload interface includes context and documentType fields
- **Database**: Firestore documents now support context and documentType fields

### Frontend
- **Modal Component**: `NewDocumentModal` provides enhanced document creation UI
- **State Management**: Uses Zustand document store with enhanced `createDocument` action
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript interfaces ensure type safety across the application
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS

### User Flow
1. User clicks "New Document" button on Dashboard
2. Modal opens with form fields:
   - Title (optional)
   - Context description (optional)
   - Document type selection based on user role (optional)
3. User fills out desired fields and clicks "Create Document"
4. Document is created directly in Firestore with provided data
5. User is redirected to the editor with the new document

## Files Modified/Created

### Created
- `src/constants/documentConstants.ts` - Document type definitions and UI text
- `src/components/NewDocumentModal.tsx` - Modal component for document creation

### Modified
- `src/types/index.ts` - Added context and documentType to Document interface, updated DocumentCreatePayload
- `src/constants/userConstants.ts` - Simplified to 2 roles
- `src/components/DocumentList.tsx` - Integrated new document modal
- `src/store/document/document.actions.ts` - Enhanced createDocument action to handle new fields
- `src/store/document/document.types.ts` - Updated DocumentState interface
- `functions/src/handlers/userProfile.ts` - Updated role validation

### Removed
- `functions/src/handlers/document.ts` - Removed Firebase Function (simplified to direct Firestore operations)

## Future Enhancements

The context and documentType data is now stored with each document and can be used for:
- Tailored AI suggestions based on document type
- Context-aware writing assistance
- Document templates and examples
- Analytics and insights based on document patterns

## Testing

- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes
- ✅ ESLint passes with no errors
- ✅ Frontend build successful
- ✅ Firebase Functions build successful
- ✅ All existing tests pass

## Architecture Decision

**Simplified Implementation**: The feature was initially implemented with Firebase Functions but was simplified to use direct Firestore operations for better performance and reduced complexity. This approach:

- Reduces latency by eliminating the function call overhead
- Simplifies the codebase by removing the need for a separate backend function
- Maintains the same functionality while being more efficient
- Leverages existing document creation patterns in the application

The feature is now ready for use and provides a solid foundation for enhanced AI-powered writing assistance.
