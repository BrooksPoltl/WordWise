### Feature: Style Enhancement & UX Overhaul

### Session Summary (Latest Session - Race Condition & Passive Voice Fixes)
This session focused on debugging and resolving critical issues with the passive voice implementation and AI rewrite functionality.

**Critical Issues Identified & Resolved:**

1. **Race Condition Bug in AI Rewrites** 🐛➡️✅
   - **Problem**: AI rewrites (readability, passive) were being lost when text changed during API calls. Suggestion IDs would change mid-request, causing responses to fail when trying to update non-existent suggestions.
   - **Root Cause**: Content-based suggestion IDs were regenerating on every text change, making long-running AI requests unable to find their original suggestions.
   - **Solution Implemented**: 
     - **localStorage Cache with TTL**: Created `src/utils/rewriteCache.ts` with 30-minute expiration, content-based hashing, and automatic cleanup.
     - **Lazy Retry Pattern**: Instead of automatic retries, implemented on-demand retry when users open popovers. If no rewrite exists, fresh API request is made with current (non-stale) data.
     - **Cost-Effective**: Only retries on user interaction, uses browser storage, eliminates wasted API calls.

2. **Passive Voice Sentence Replacement Issues** 🐛➡️✅
   - **Problem**: "Accept" was only replacing the passive phrase (e.g., "is sent") instead of the entire sentence with the AI rewrite.
   - **Root Cause**: `handleAcceptSuggestion` was using `popoverState.from/to` (highlighting range) instead of full sentence boundaries.
   - **Solution Implemented**: 
     - **Sentence Boundary Detection**: Created `src/utils/sentenceBoundaries.ts` using regex patterns to detect sentence start/end positions.
     - **Sentence-Level Replacement**: For passive suggestions only, replace entire sentence instead of just highlighted words.
     - **Punctuation Handling**: Simplified approach - strip trailing punctuation from AI responses to prevent double periods.

3. **Highlighting System Debugging** 🔍✅
   - **Initial Issue**: User reported passive voice highlighting was broken, but investigation revealed ALL highlighting was broken.
   - **Debugging Process**: Added extensive logging to `passiveAnalyzer.ts`, `useSuggestions.ts`, and `SuggestionDecorations.ts` to trace the suggestion pipeline.
   - **Resolution**: Issues were resolved through the race condition fixes and proper sentence boundary implementation.

**Technical Implementation Details:**

- **Cache Implementation**: `rewriteCache.ts` uses content hashing (MD5) as keys, stores JSON with TTL timestamps, handles errors gracefully.
- **Sentence Boundaries**: Regex-based detection looking for `.!?` terminators, handles edge cases like text without punctuation.
- **Punctuation Strategy**: Simple approach - always strip AI response punctuation, preserve original sentence punctuation.
- **Lazy Loading**: AI rewrites only trigger on user demand (popover open), not automatically on detection.

**Architecture Improvements:**
- Eliminated automatic AI rewrite triggers from `useSuggestions.ts`
- Centralized caching logic in dedicated utility
- Improved error handling and user experience for failed AI requests
- Reduced API costs through intelligent retry patterns

**Key Lessons Learned:**

1. **Race Conditions in Real-Time Systems**: Content-based IDs that regenerate on every change are incompatible with long-running async operations. Solution: Use stable caching mechanisms with TTL instead of relying on ephemeral suggestion IDs.

2. **User Experience vs. Performance**: Automatic AI rewrites create poor UX when they fail due to race conditions. Lazy loading (on-demand) provides better reliability and cost control.

3. **Debugging Complex Systems**: When one feature appears broken, investigate the entire pipeline - the issue may be systemic rather than isolated.

4. **Simplicity Wins**: Complex sentence boundary logic with punctuation matching was error-prone. Simple approach (strip AI punctuation) was more reliable and maintainable.

5. **Cache Strategy**: Browser localStorage with TTL is effective for expensive operations that don't need real-time updates. Content hashing provides good cache keys for text-based operations.

**Files Created/Modified in This Session:**

- **NEW**: `src/utils/rewriteCache.ts` - TTL-based localStorage cache for AI rewrites
- **NEW**: `src/utils/sentenceBoundaries.ts` - Sentence boundary detection utility  
- **MODIFIED**: `src/hooks/usePassiveRewrite.ts` - Added lazy retry and cache integration
- **MODIFIED**: `src/hooks/useReadabilityRewrite.ts` - Added lazy retry and cache integration
- **MODIFIED**: `src/components/editor/PassiveSuggestionPopover.tsx` - Added lazy retry button
- **MODIFIED**: `src/components/editor/ReadabilitySuggestionPopover.tsx` - Added lazy retry button
- **MODIFIED**: `src/components/TextEditor.tsx` - Added sentence-level replacement for passive suggestions
- **MODIFIED**: `src/hooks/useSuggestions.ts` - Removed automatic AI rewrite triggers

**Current Status**: Passive voice detection and replacement is now fully functional with proper race condition handling, sentence-level replacements, and intelligent caching. The system is ready for production use.

### Session Summary (End of Last Session)
This document has been updated to reflect the significant progress made in refactoring the suggestion UI from a sidebar to an inline, popover-based system.

**Key Accomplishments:**
- **Complete UI/UX Overhaul:** The old `SuggestionSidebar` was successfully deprecated and replaced with a modern, inline suggestion model using Tiptap decorations and popovers.
- **Component Architecture:** We implemented a scalable popover system where a main `SuggestionPopover.tsx` acts as a dispatcher, routing suggestion data to specialized components like `SpellingSuggestionPopover.tsx`, `ClaritySuggestionPopover.tsx`, and `ConcisenessSuggestionPopover.tsx`.
- **Feature Implementation:** We fully implemented "Clarity (Weasel Words)" and "Conciseness (Wordy Phrases)" suggestions using `retext-equality` and `retext-simplify`. This included creating custom, user-friendly explanations for weasel words.
- **State Management:** The `suggestionStore` (Zustand) was successfully integrated and now serves as the single source of truth for all suggestion types, managed by the `useSuggestions` hook.
- **Robustness:** A critical race condition was solved by adding validation logic to `SuggestionDecorations.ts`, preventing crashes when deleting text containing suggestions.
- **Future-Proofing:** We laid the groundwork for the "Readability" feature by installing the required dependencies (`retext-readability`, `retext-passive`) and creating the initial `readabilityAnalyzer.ts`.

### 1. Feature Summary & Context

This document outlines the plan for implementing a new **Style Enhancement** feature in AlignWrite and a concurrent **UX Overhaul** for how all suggestions (including existing spell-checking) are presented to the user.

The primary goal is to provide users with real-time, actionable suggestions to improve the **clarity**, **conciseness**, and **readability** of their writing, while simultaneously modernizing the application's core user interaction model for suggestions.

### 2. Core Technology: The `retext` Ecosystem

After initial exploration of lower-level NLP libraries like `natural`, we have chosen to build this feature on the **`retext`** ecosystem. This decision is strategic:

*   **Modularity & Precision:** `retext`'s plugin-based architecture allows us to precisely target specific writing issues with dedicated, community-vetted packages. Its AST-based approach provides exact positional data for highlighting and replacing text.
*   **Industry Trust & Stability:** As a core part of the `unified` collective, `retext` is a well-maintained, stable, and trusted tool used in major projects by companies like Mozilla, Gatsby, and Shopify. This mitigates the risk of building on an unsupported or volatile dependency.

### 3. New User Experience Vision

We have successfully moved away from the `SuggestionSidebar` to an inline, contextual model.

*   **Inline Underlines and Pop-ups:** All suggestions now appear as colored underlines directly within the text editor.
    *   **Spelling:** Red underline.
    *   **Clarity:** Blue underline.
    *   **Conciseness:** Green underline.
    *   **Readability:** Purple underline.
    *   Interacting with an underline triggers a **`SuggestionPopover`**.
    *   **Architecture:** The `SuggestionPopover` is a dispatcher component that, based on the suggestion type, renders a more specific component (e.g., `SpellingSuggestionPopover`, `ClaritySuggestionPopover`). This makes the system scalable and easy to maintain.

*   **Lazy-Loading LLM Suggestions:** To provide powerful suggestions without perceived latency, we will use a hybrid approach for complex suggestions like passive voice and readability improvements.
    *   **Instant Detection:** A `retext` plugin (e.g., `retext-passive`, `retext-readability`) will instantly detect a potential issue and apply the appropriate underline.
    *   **Background Fetch:** The moment the underline appears, a non-blocking request will be sent to our backend.
    *   **AI-Powered Rewrite:** The backend will use the `gpt-4o` model to rewrite the sentence (e.g., in the active voice or as a simpler sentence).
    *   **Seamless UI Update:** The result will be sent back to the client. When the user clicks the underline, the `SuggestionPopover` will ideally already be populated with the high-quality AI suggestion. If the call is still in progress, a loading state will be shown.

*   **Suggestion Category Toggles:** To give users control over the density of feedback, a new UI element has been added to the editor toolbar.
    *   This component (`SuggestionToggles.tsx`) contains a list of clickable toggles for each suggestion category.
    *   Each toggle displays the category name and a live count of active suggestions in that category.
    *   Clicking a toggle shows or hide the corresponding underlines in the editor, allowing users to focus on one type of improvement at a time.

### 4. Detailed Feature Breakdown

The Style Enhancement feature is composed of the following checks, managed by the unified `useSuggestions` hook:

*   **Clarity Enhancement (Blue - `#3B82F6`)**
    *   **Passive Voice Detection:** Using `retext-passive`, we will identify sentences written in the passive voice. This serves as the trigger for the lazy-loaded LLM rewrite. The pop-up will explain *why* active voice is often better and offer the AI-generated alternative.
    *   **Weasel Word Detection:** Using `retext-equality`, we flag weak, hedging, or overly assertive words. The suggestion typically is to remove the word for a stronger statement. **This is complete, including custom, user-friendly explanations.** ✅

*   **Conciseness Enhancement (Green - `#10B981`)**
    *   **Wordy Phrase Simplification:** Using `retext-simplify`, we find and offer simpler, more direct alternatives for common verbose phrases (e.g., suggest "use" for "utilize", "about" for "in regards to", "to" for "in order to"). These are one-click replacements. ✅

*   **Readability Enhancement (Purple - `#8B5CF6`)**
    *   **Complex Sentence Flagging & Simplification:** Using `retext-readability`, we will calculate readability scores (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid) on the fly. Sentences that fall below a certain readability threshold (indicating they are too long or complex) will be underlined. This serves as the trigger for a lazy-loaded LLM rewrite to offer a simpler, more readable version of the sentence. ✅

### 5. Implementation Plan

### 6. Refactor Notes & Incremental Implementation Strategy

This section outlines the phased approach to implementing the Style Enhancement and UX Overhaul, focusing on incremental delivery and minimizing disruption.

**Key Principle for Refactor:** The initial phase of this refactor focuses *only* on changing the User Interface and User Experience for how suggestions are presented. The underlying logic for *how* spell-checking suggestions are generated (i.e., the `useSpellCheck.ts` hook and its dependencies) **will not be changed** in the initial increments. The existing `nspell` implementation is working well and will be retained. We are swapping out the presentation layer first.

---

**Increment 1: Foundational UX Replacement (Spelling Only - Phased)**

*   **Goal:** Completely replace the existing spell-check sidebar and score with the new inline, popover-based UX, focusing *only* on spelling errors. This ensures a direct feature swap with a new UI, without changing the underlying spell-check logic itself.
*   **Phased Tasks for this Increment:**
    1.  **Deprecate and Remove Old UI (Easiest First):**
        *   Task: Remove the `SuggestionSidebar` component from `DocumentEditor.tsx`.
            *   Details: Delete component import and usage.
            *   Code Pointers: `src/components/DocumentEditor.tsx`
        *   Task: Delete the `SuggestionSidebar.tsx` file.
            *   Details: Remove the file and any associated CSS or utility files specific to it.
            *   Code Pointers: `src/components/SuggestionSidebar.tsx`
        *   Task: Remove the "Spell Score" UI element.
            *   Details: Identify and remove the JSX and logic for displaying the spell score.
            *   Code Pointers: `src/components/editor/EditorHeader.tsx` (likely)
    2.  **Build and Test Core New UI for Spelling (Using Existing Logic):**
        *   Task: Create the `SuggestionPopover.tsx` component.
            *   Details: Build the reusable popover UI that will display suggestion details and actions. Initially, it will handle spelling suggestions.
            *   Code Pointers: `src/components/editor/SuggestionPopover.tsx` (new)
        *   Task: Create the `SuggestionDecorations.ts` Tiptap extension.
            *   Details: Develop the Tiptap extension to apply underlines to text based on suggestion data.
            *   Code Pointers: `src/extensions/SuggestionDecorations.ts` (new)
        *   Task: Integrate Popover and Decorations for Spell Check (Phased).
            *   **1.6.1: Render Spell-Check Underlines:** Reconnect `useSpellCheck` hook, implement logic in `SuggestionDecorations.ts` to draw underlines, add the extension to Tiptap, and add CSS for the styling.
            *   **1.6.2: Position and Trigger the Popover:** Add state to `TextEditor.tsx` to manage the popover's visibility and position. Add a Tiptap click handler to show the popover on interaction with a decoration.
            *   **1.6.3: Implement Popover Actions:** Build out the `SuggestionPopover.tsx` UI to show details and "Accept"/"Dismiss" buttons. Wire up the buttons to either apply the correction or hide the popover.
            *   Code Pointers: `src/components/TextEditor.tsx`, `src/hooks/useSpellCheck.ts`, `src/extensions/SuggestionDecorations.ts`, `src/components/editor/SuggestionPopover.tsx`
    3.  **Introduce State Management for Scalability (`suggestionStore`):**
        *   Task: Create the `suggestion.store.ts` (Zustand).
            *   Details: Define the store structure to hold suggestion data. Initially, it will be populated with spelling errors from `useSpellCheck.ts`.
            *   Code Pointers: `src/store/suggestion/suggestion.store.ts` (new), `src/store/suggestion/suggestion.types.ts` (new)
        *   Task: Refactor `TextEditor` to use `suggestionStore`.
            *   Details: Modify `TextEditor.tsx` (and potentially `DocumentEditor.tsx` or a relevant hook) to populate the `suggestionStore` with spell check results and read from the store to display suggestions. This ensures the store is correctly integrated.
            *   Code Pointers: `src/components/TextEditor.tsx`, `src/hooks/useSpellCheck.ts` (for populating the store)
    4.  **Final Editor Integration Review:**
        *   Task: Ensure `DocumentEditor.tsx` and `TextEditor.tsx` are correctly and efficiently using the `suggestionStore` and the new UI components (`SuggestionPopover`, `SuggestionDecorations.ts`) for a seamless inline spell-checking experience.
        *   Code Pointers: `src/components/DocumentEditor.tsx`, `src/components/TextEditor.tsx`
