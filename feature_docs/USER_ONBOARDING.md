# User Onboarding Enhancement Plan

## Feature Summary

This document outlines the plan to implement a new user onboarding flow. This flow will appear immediately after a user creates an account and before they access the main dashboard. The primary goal is to capture the user's professional role and an optional, descriptive persona. This information is crucial for personalizing the user experience, which includes tailoring AI-powered suggestions and providing relevant document templates in future updates.

The feature also includes the creation of a new User Profile page, allowing users to update their role and persona at any time. The main header UI will be updated to replace the current standalone sign-out button with a profile dropdown menu containing links to the new Profile page and the sign-out action.

## User Roles

The following roles will be presented to the user during onboarding. This list will be stored in a constants file and validated on the backend.
-   Product Manager
-   Software Engineer

## User-Facing Text Strings

-   **Onboarding Page Title**: "Welcome to WordWise! Let's personalize your experience."
-   **Role Selection Sub-header**: "By understanding your role, we can provide you with tailored suggestions, document templates, and insights to help you write more effectively."
-   **Persona Section Title**: "Supercharge your suggestions."
-   **Persona Section Description**: "Give WordWise more context about what you do. The more detail you provide (like your industry, company, or specific projects), the more insightful and relevant the AI's feedback will become. This is optional but highly recommended for the best experience."

## Backend Tasks

| Priority | Task Description | Implementation Details | Code Pointers | Dependencies | Completed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |:--- |:--- |:--- |
| **P1** | Update Firestore Security Rules | Modify `firestore.rules` to allow authenticated users to read and write the `role` and `persona` fields on their own user document in the `users` collection. Ensure other users cannot read or write to this document. | `firestore.rules` | - | ☑️ |
| **P1** | Update User Data Types | Add `role: string`, `persona: string`, and `onboardingCompleted: boolean` to the user data model/interface. | `src/store/user/user.types.ts` | - | ☑️ |
| **P2** | Implement Backend Validation for Role | Add logic in a new or existing Firebase Function to ensure the `role` field submitted by the client is one of the predefined valid roles. This prevents arbitrary data from being saved. | `functions/src/handlers/userProfile.ts` | Backend: User Data Types | ☑️ |

## Frontend Tasks

| Priority | Task Description | Implementation Details | Code Pointers | Dependencies | Completed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |:--- |:--- |:--- |
| **P1** | Create User Constants | Create a file to store the list of user roles. This makes the list easily maintainable and reusable. | `src/constants/userConstants.ts` (New File) | - | ☑️ |
| **P1** | Update Zustand User Store | Add `role`, `persona`, and `onboardingCompleted` to the user store's state and types. | `src/store/user/user.store.ts`, `src/store/user/user.types.ts` | Backend: User Data Types | ☑️ |
| **P1** | Implement User Profile Update Action | Create a new action that updates the user's `role`, `persona`, and sets `onboardingCompleted` to `true` in Firestore. This action should update the Zustand store upon success. | `src/store/user/user.actions.ts` | Zustand: User Store Update | ☑️ |
| **P2** | Create Onboarding Page Route & Component | Create a new page component for the onboarding flow. This includes the UI for role selection (grid of cards) and persona input (textarea), along with the explanatory text. | `src/components/Onboarding.tsx` (New File), Add route in `src/App.tsx` | User Constants, User Profile Update Action | ☑️ |
| **P2** | Implement Conditional Redirect for New Users | In the main application wrapper, check if the authenticated user has `onboardingCompleted: false`. If so, redirect them to the `/onboarding` route. Otherwise, allow them to proceed to the dashboard. | `src/components/AuthWrapper.tsx` or `src/App.tsx` | Onboarding Page Component | ☑️ |
| **P2** | Create Profile Page Route & Component | Create a new page component where users can view and edit their `role` and `persona`. The page should fetch the user's current data and use the `updateUserProfile` action to save changes. | `src/components/Profile.tsx` (New File), Add route in `src/App.tsx` | User Profile Update Action | ☑️ |
| **P3** | Update Header/Profile Indicator UI | Modify the existing profile indicator to be a dropdown menu. Remove the old standalone sign-out button. The dropdown will contain links to the new "Profile" page (`/profile`) and the existing "Sign Out" functionality. | `src/components/Dashboard.tsx`, `src/components/DocumentEditor.tsx` | Profile Page Component | ☑️ |

## Code Implementation Summary

### 🎯 **Core Feature Overview**

The User Onboarding Enhancement adds a personalization layer to WordWise that captures user professional context immediately after account creation. This enables future AI-powered features to provide more relevant suggestions based on the user's role and work environment.

**Key Flow:**
1. User creates account → 2. Onboarding page (role + persona) → 3. Dashboard with personalized experience

### 📁 **File Structure & Components**

#### **Constants & Configuration**
```typescript
// src/constants/userConstants.ts
export const USER_ROLES = ['Product Manager', 'Software Engineer'] as const;
export type UserRole = typeof USER_ROLES[number];
export const ONBOARDING_TEXT = { /* UI text constants */ };
```

#### **Data Types & Store Management**
```typescript
// src/types/index.ts - Extended User interface
interface User {
  // ... existing fields
  role?: UserRole;
  persona?: string;
  onboardingCompleted?: boolean;
}

// src/store/user/user.actions.ts - Profile update action
export const updateProfile = async (profileData: { role: UserRole; persona?: string }) => {
  // Calls Firebase Function, updates Zustand store on success
};
```

#### **Backend Validation & Security**
```typescript
// functions/src/handlers/userProfile.ts - Firebase Function
const updateUserProfileSchema = z.object({
  role: z.enum(USER_ROLES), // Validates against predefined roles
  persona: z.string().max(1000).optional(),
});

// Firestore security rules updated to allow user profile field access
```

### 🎨 **UI Components & User Experience**

#### **1. Onboarding Component (`src/components/Onboarding.tsx`)**
- **Purpose**: First-time user role selection and persona input
- **Layout**: Mobile-first responsive grid (1→2→3 columns)
- **Features**:
  - Role selection cards with consistent heights (`min-h-[4rem]`)
  - Optional persona textarea with character counter (1000 max)
  - Form validation and error handling
  - Loading states and skip option
  - Auto-redirect to dashboard on completion

```typescript
// Key features:
- Role selection: Grid of clickable cards with hover effects
- Persona input: Textarea with character counter and placeholder text
- Form validation: Prevents submission without role selection
- Loading states: Shows spinner during API calls
- Error handling: Displays backend validation errors
```

#### **2. Profile Management (`src/components/Profile.tsx`)**
- **Purpose**: Allow users to edit their role and persona after onboarding
- **Features**:
  - Pre-populated form with current user data
  - Same role selection UI as onboarding for consistency
  - "Save Changes" button only enabled when changes are detected
  - Automatic redirect back to previous page after saving
  - Account information display (email, name)

```typescript
// Key features:
- Change detection: Button disabled when no changes made
- Navigation: Uses navigate(-1) to return to previous page
- Error handling: Shows validation errors from backend
- Loading states: Prevents multiple submissions
```

#### **3. Profile Dropdown UI Enhancement**
Updated both `Dashboard.tsx` and `DocumentEditor.tsx` with consistent profile dropdown menus:

```typescript
// Features:
- Clickable profile avatar with dropdown arrow
- User info display (email, role)
- "Profile Settings" navigation link
- "Sign Out" functionality
- Click-outside-to-close behavior
- Consistent styling across both components
```

### 🔄 **Routing & Navigation Logic**

#### **App.tsx - Conditional Routing**
```typescript
// Helper functions for clean routing logic:
const needsOnboarding = user && !user.onboardingCompleted;
const getAuthenticatedRedirect = () => needsOnboarding ? '/onboarding' : '/dashboard';

// Route protection:
- /onboarding: Only accessible to authenticated users who haven't completed onboarding
- /profile: Only accessible to authenticated users who have completed onboarding
- /dashboard, /editor: Redirect to onboarding if not completed
```

#### **Auth Store Integration (`src/store/auth/auth.listener.ts`)**
```typescript
// Loads user profile fields from Firestore:
const userData = {
  // ... existing fields
  role: userDoc.data()?.role,
  persona: userDoc.data()?.persona,
  onboardingCompleted: userDoc.data()?.onboardingCompleted || false,
};
```

### 🔒 **Security & Validation**

#### **Backend Validation (Firebase Functions)**
```typescript
// Zod schema validation:
- Role: Must be one of predefined USER_ROLES enum
- Persona: Optional string, max 1000 characters
- Authentication: Requires valid Firebase Auth token
- Authorization: Users can only update their own profile
```

#### **Firestore Security Rules**
```javascript
// Users can read/write their own profile fields:
allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
```

### 📱 **Responsive Design Features**

#### **Mobile-First Approach**
```css
/* Role selection grid adapts to screen size: */
grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3

/* Typography scales appropriately: */
text-sm md:text-base
text-2xl md:text-3xl

/* Spacing adjusts for mobile: */
p-6 md:p-8
py-8 px-4
```

#### **Consistent Card Heights**
```css
/* Prevents layout issues with varying text lengths: */
min-h-[4rem] flex items-center
items-stretch (on grid container)
```

### 🎯 **Key Technical Decisions**

1. **Firebase Functions over REST API**: Uses `httpsCallable()` for type safety and Firebase integration
2. **Zustand State Management**: Immediate store updates after successful backend calls
3. **Mobile-First Design**: Responsive grid system that works on all devices
4. **Form Validation**: Both frontend (UX) and backend (security) validation
5. **Navigation Patterns**: Uses React Router's `navigate(-1)` for intuitive back navigation
6. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with user-friendly error messages
7. **Loading States**: Prevents double-submissions and provides user feedback

### 🚀 **Production Readiness**

- ✅ **TypeScript**: Full type safety across frontend and backend
- ✅ **Linting**: All ESLint rules satisfied
- ✅ **Testing**: Basic test suite passing
- ✅ **Build Process**: Both frontend and Firebase Functions build successfully
- ✅ **Security**: Proper authentication, authorization, and input validation
- ✅ **Performance**: Minimal bundle size impact, efficient state management
- ✅ **Accessibility**: Proper semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, screen reader support

The feature is fully implemented, tested, and ready for production deployment.
