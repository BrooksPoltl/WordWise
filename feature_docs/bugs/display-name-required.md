# Bug: Display Name is Required on Sign-Up

- **Priority**: Low
- **Status**: Not Started

## Description

The user sign-up form is intended to have an optional "Display Name" field, but the registration process fails if the user leaves it blank. This creates an unnecessary barrier to entry for new users. The goal is to make the display name truly optional.

## Code Analysis

The investigation followed the data flow from the UI to the backend action.

1.  **UI (`SignUp.tsx`)**: The UI component correctly treats the field as optional. The `<input>` for `displayName` does not have the `required` attribute, and the client-side `validateForm` function does not check for its presence. The form correctly allows submission without a display name.

2.  **Authentication Action (`auth.actions.ts`)**: The problem lies in the `signUp` function in `auth.actions.ts`. When a new user is created, the system also creates a corresponding user profile document in Firestore. The existing code creates the `userProfile` object and assigns `userData.displayName` to the `displayName` field. If the user didn't provide a name, this value is `''` (an empty string).

The bug is not a crash, but a flaw in the design. The rest of the application assumes that `user.displayName` is a non-empty string, but the current sign-up logic allows it to be empty. For example, UI components might try to access `user.displayName.charAt(0)` to get the user's initial for an avatar, which would fail or produce an undesirable result if the name is empty.

## Proposed Solutions

### Solution 1: (Recommended) Provide a Default Display Name from Email

- **Description**: In `src/store/auth/auth.actions.ts`, modify the creation of the `userProfile` object. If the `userData.displayName` is empty or whitespace, create a default display name from the user's email address (e.g., the part before the `@` symbol).

    ```typescript
    // In src/store/auth/auth.actions.ts

    const displayName = userData.displayName?.trim() 
      ? userData.displayName.trim() 
      : firebaseUser.email.split('@')[0];

    const userProfile: User = {
      // ...
      displayName: displayName,
      // ...
    };
    ```

- **Level of Effort**: Low.
- **Tradeoffs**: This is a clean, robust solution. It keeps the field optional for the user but guarantees that every user profile has a sensible, non-empty `displayName`. This prevents errors in other parts of the app and provides a better default user experience.
- **Why it's likely the fix**: It directly addresses the problem of the empty display name by providing a graceful fallback, ensuring data consistency for the rest of the application.
- **Why it might not be the fix**: This is almost certainly the correct and most professional way to fix this issue.

### Solution 2: Make the Entire App Handle Null Display Names

- **Description**: Audit the entire codebase for every usage of `user.displayName` and add defensive code to handle cases where it might be empty, `null`, or `undefined`. This would involve adding fallback logic in every component that displays a user's name or initial.
- **Level of Effort**: High.
- **Tradeoffs**: This is a far more complex and risky solution. It requires touching many files and increases the chance of introducing new bugs. It solves the problem by adding complexity everywhere, rather than solving it at the source.
- **Why it might be the fix**: It would make the application technically capable of handling users without display names.
- **Why it might not be the fix**: It's a high-effort, high-risk approach that indicates a failure to enforce data consistency at the source.

### Solution 3: Make the Field Required

- **Description**: Go back to `SignUp.tsx` and make the `displayName` input field required. Add a check to the `validateForm` function.
- **Level of Effort**: Low.
- **Tradeoffs**: This technically "fixes" the problem of the empty display name but does so by rejecting the original goal of making the field optional. It prioritizes technical convenience over the desired user experience.
- **Why it might be the fix**: It would ensure a `displayName` is always provided.
- **Why it might not be the fix**: It fails to deliver on the product requirement.

## Conclusion

**Solution 1** is the best choice by a wide margin. It provides a simple, elegant, and low-risk fix that achieves the goal of making the display name optional for the user while ensuring data integrity and a good default experience throughout the application. It solves the problem at its source.
